This project analyzes Spotify data using SQL to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and complex queries. Key tasks include calculating correlations, ranking tracks, and aggregating metrics like streams, views, and likes. It also applies window functions to derive insights on top tracks, energy differences, and artist contributions.
